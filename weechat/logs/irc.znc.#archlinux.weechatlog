So if i lookup a domain from the last 2 nameservers i just get the not found msg from the first server. How can I force my system to using every nameserver entry in the resolv.conf ?

2013-02-28 16:21:09	Spiralsorrow	Hello all. I'm well versed in installing arch on BIOS systems, but have never installed on UEFI system before, and am trying to walk a friend through install over the phone. Having loaded the efivars module /sys/firmware/efi is not created or populated, leading me to assume the install DVD was not UEFI loaded. The only documentation I can find on this suggests loading a UEFI shell onto USB stick and manually loading grub from shell. Is it possible 
2013-02-28 16:21:10	gtmanfred	it is part of the kdesdk package base
2013-02-28 16:21:10	Spiralsorrow	to install arch on UEFI systems from DVD without use of USB media?
