2013-02-28 15:07:54	fogobogo	velcroshooz: so what happened to the shoulder?
2013-02-28 15:09:21	fogobogo	fell from your tree?

2013-02-28 15:09:48	fogobogo	so now your right arm will rot off?

2013-02-28 15:12:46	halosghost	it's not just pain
2013-02-28 15:13:29	halosghost	for the shoulder, you can move most other parts of your arm, but moving anything near the shoulder just feels like you know it will hurt massively if you even nudge it
2013-02-28 15:13:31	halosghost	and it does
2013-02-28 15:13:37	velcroshooz	it feels out of place, youve got barely any movement whatsoever, and it hurts like all hell until they put it back in

2013-02-28 15:15:58	fogobogo	hmm. had something like that once or twice but went away after a week or so
2013-02-28 15:16:08	halosghost	I managed to get mine dislocated during a sport, but there were no replacements and I was leading my team, so I just had one of my friends reset it for me on the field
