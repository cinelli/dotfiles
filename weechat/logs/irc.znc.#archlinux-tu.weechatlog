2013-02-28 04:08:59	xyproto	jsteel: if you tried running "gdb /usr/bin/cower" and then type "r" it should run it with gdb

2013-02-28 04:13:10	xyproto	aha! :)
2013-02-28 04:13:28	jsteel	my old computer was i686, now it's x86_64. I rebuild the package, but something must have been left over in srcdir or something...
2013-02-28 04:13:40	xyproto	probably
2013-02-28 04:13:45	jsteel	I deleted srcdir and pkgdir and rebuilt, and now it's fine
2013-02-28 04:14:18	jsteel	xyproto: thanks for the help, it's nice to know what went wrong
2013-02-28 04:14:40	xyproto	it's really confusing when running a binary produces a message that says that the binary in question isn't there, but in my experience, it's always the issue with which .so file it should run itself with, for that case
